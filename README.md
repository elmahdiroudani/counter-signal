Counter Signal Component
A simple Angular project demonstrating the use of Reactive Signals to manage state, along with unit tests written in Jasmine. This project features a counter component that displays a count, computes a derived double value, and includes a button to increment the count.

Overview
The Counter Signal Component is a lightweight example of Angular's new reactive signals (introduced in Angular 16). It shows how to create a reactive state with signals, derive computed values, and automatically update the UI when the state changes. The project also includes unit tests that verify the functionality of the component.

Features
Reactive State Management:
Uses Angular's reactive signals to manage state with simplicity and fine-grained reactivity.

Computed Values:
Demonstrates how to create computed signals that derive values from existing state (e.g., double the counter).

User Interaction:
Provides a button to increment the counter, updating both the base count and the computed value.

Unit Testing:
Contains unit tests using Jasmine to ensure that the component initializes correctly, increments as expected, and that computed values update in sync.

Technologies
Angular (standalone components) – A modern framework for building scalable web applications.

TypeScript – Provides static typing and modern JavaScript features.

Angular Reactive Signals – New reactive primitives for state management.

Jasmine & Karma – For unit testing the component.

Angular CLI – For project scaffolding, serving, and building.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/counter-signal.git
cd counter-signal
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

bash
Copy
npm install
Running the Application
To serve the application locally, run:

bash
Copy
ng serve
Then, open your browser at http://localhost:4200 to see the Counter Signal component in action.

Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute:

bash
Copy
ng test
This command will launch Karma and run the Jasmine tests, displaying the results in your browser and terminal.

How It Works
Reactive Signals:
The component defines a signal count and a computed signal doubleCount. When the increment() method is called (via a button click), the count signal updates, and the computed doubleCount recalculates automatically.

Unit Tests:
The Jasmine tests verify that:

The component is created successfully.

The initial count is zero.

The increment() method correctly increments the count.

The computed value (doubleCount) correctly reflects double the count.
